1) Compare current diff to `docs/specs/$1-plan.md` acceptance checks and **Golden Rules**.
2) Run three short passes and consolidate:
   - ðŸ”’ **Security**: secrets/config, injection surfaces, risky I/O.
   - ðŸ“– **Readability/Perf**: clarity, needless abstraction, hot paths.
   - âœ… **Tests**: contract coverage per plan; missing edges; over-testing internals.
3) Output **one line**: `APPROVE` or `REQUEST-CHANGES`.
4) Then bullets: `file:line â†’ issue â†’ which acceptance check / rule it violates`.
