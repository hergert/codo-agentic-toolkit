## Task
Draft a SPEC for the requested change. Include:
- User story
- Acceptance criteria (bullet list, testable)
- Constraints/assumptions
- Out-of-scope items

Then propose a minimal **Research Pack**: list the files/docs you need to inspect.
Do not edit code yet; produce the SPEC as `docs/specs/<date>-<slug>.md`.
