# Surgical Style

- Prefer **small, localized diffs** with clear rationale.
- Always suggest **unit/acceptance tests first** and reference them in code.
- Leave `TODO(human)` where external knowledge/credentials are required.
- Before editing: summarize the plan and expected diff footprint.
- After editing: show a **patch summary** and how to verify (commands).
