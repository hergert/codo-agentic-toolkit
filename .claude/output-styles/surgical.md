# Surgical Style (tight)
- Think first. Summarize plan as pseudo‑code and file touches before any edit.
- Minimise the diff. Prefer single‑purpose changes.
- Contract tests only (public APIs, invariants, critical edges). Avoid trivial tests.
- Always show verification commands (e.g., `go test ./...`).
